# Currency_Project

Please refer to the report for the details of how the project was carried out. Superficially speaking, we created algorithms for determining betting payoffs and probabilities, and then we created a virtual currency which gave the clients exclusive rights to bet in the sport events of the the 3 day college fest. The implemented algorithms were so made so that the developers of the market do not make any profit from any of the betting activites. Instead, they were created to reveal information about what value the markets give to the competing teams. We also created a website with a databse to facilitate and record all transactions (for further analysis, which will be uploaded in a few days). 

We have uploaded the python code in which initially all work was done. Eventually, we shifted to Excel to increase transparency of our work. 

When we were working in Python, there were three files: 
1) lmsr: this was the file in which the initial algorithm was written. This can be easily vhanged to LS-LMSR.
2) implement: This was the file in which lmsr was imported and then implemented. A register was kept in which all the bets were recorded.
3) access_register: This was the file through which we could see the record. There is also commented out code which can be run to clear the record.
