# Currency_Project

Please refer to the report for the details of how the project was carried out. Superficially speaking, we created algorithms for determining betting payoffs and probabilities, and then we created a virtual currency which gave the clients exclusive rights to bet in the sport events of the the 3 day college fest. The implemented algorithms were so made so that the developers of the market do not make any profit from any of the betting activites. Instead, they were created to reveal information about what value the markets give to the competing teams. 

We have uploaded the python code in which initially ll work was done. Eventually, we shifted to Excel to increase transparency of our work.
